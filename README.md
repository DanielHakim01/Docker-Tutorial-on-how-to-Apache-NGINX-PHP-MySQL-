### **What is Docker?**

Docker is a free and open platform for building, delivering, and operating apps. Docker allows you to decouple your apps from your infrastructure, allowing you to swiftly release software. You can manage your infrastructure the same way you control your applications with Docker. You may drastically minimise the time between writing code and executing it in production by leveraging Docker's approaches for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly.


Docker allows you to bundle and run an application in a container, which is a loosely isolated environment. Because of the isolation and security, you can operate multiple containers on the same host at the same time. Containers are small and include everything needed to operate an application, so you don't have to rely on what's already on the host. While you're working, you can quickly share containers and ensure that everyone gets the same container that operates the same way.


Docker provides tools and a framework for managing container lifecycles:
Containers can be used to develop your application and its supporting components.
Your application's container becomes the unit for distributing and testing it.
When you're ready, deploy your application as a container or an orchestrated service into your production environment. Whether your production environment is a local data centre, a cloud provider, or a hybrid of the two, this works the same.

**What can I use Docker for?**

**Your applications will be delivered quickly and consistently.**
Docker simplifies the development process by allowing developers to work in standardised settings while employing local containers to provide your apps and services. Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows benefit greatly from containers.

Consider the following circumstance as an example:
Your developers write code locally and use Docker containers to share it with their peers.
They use Docker to deploy their applications and run automated and manual tests in a test environment.
Developers can repair defects in the development environment before deploying them to the test environment for testing and validation.
When the testing is through, it's just a matter of releasing the revised image to the production environment to get the repair to the customer.
Scalable and responsive deployment

**The container-based Docker platform enables extremely portable workloads.**
Docker containers can run on a developer's laptop, in a data centre on real or virtual computers, in cloud providers, or in a hybrid environment.
Because of Docker's mobility and lightweight nature, it's also simple to dynamically manage workloads, scaling up or down apps and services in near real time as business needs dictate.

**Increasing the number of workloads that can be run on the same hardware**
Docker is a lightweight and quick application. It offers a practical, cost-effective alternative to hypervisor-based virtual machines, allowing you to make better use of your computational resources. Docker is ideal for high-density situations as well as small and medium deployments where more may be accomplished with fewer resources.
